# ARCS
Arduino Remote Control System (ARCS)

Version: 0.9.0

ARCS was developed by Mechanical Engineering faculty of
Afeka College of Engineering Computer Embedded Systems class.
The program was developed in National Instruments LabWindows/CVI environment.
Main goal is to allow interfacing with Arduino unit connected to a remote server.

The program is capable of creating a server which can interface with Arduino
and transmit data between a Client and Arduino unit.
Client is capable of sending data to the server including entire Sketch files
which are burned into Arduino or simple commands.
The program includes DLL with a set of functions that can be incorporated 
into any code to simplify interfacing with Arduino.
